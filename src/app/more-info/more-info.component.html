<h2>What is this?</h2>

<p>
  If you're like me, you're way behind in the Bachelor, but you can't catch up
  because you don't remember who anybody is, and googling it would lead to
  spoilers. Here's your solution. You can set the most recent episode
  and will only see who has been eliminated <i>up until that point</i>.
</p>

<p>
  I can't protect you from everything. If someone joins late, they're still
  gonna show up here and you'll know they exist. Also, if someone does something
  notable in a newer episode, it might be mentioned here even if you haven't
  seen that far. Sorry about that.
</p>

<p>
  Also. This might not be totally up to date with the most recent episodes,
  because as I said, I'm behind! If you find a bug or mistake, please let me know 
  at ifthencreate@gmail.com.
