# Bachelor App

This project is a fan-page for Season 25 of the Bachelor. It allows users to enter the most recent repisode they've seen and see the contestants without spoilers. 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.0. It uses [NGRX] (https://ngrx.io/guide/store-devtools) for state management and [ng-google-sheets-db](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ng-google-sheets-db) to store and load info about the contestants. 

This project is currently hosted with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and is available at [bachelornospoilers.netlify.app](bachelornospoilers.netlify.app).

## Development server
